# 🤖 NanaBot: An Open Bot for Hosting Project Pages

Hello! This is **NanaBot**, a "namaenashi" bot 🤖, meaning it does not represent any individual or organization. NanaBot's purpose is to anonymously publish project pages, particularly for situations like **conference submissions** 📝. Authors sometimes create project pages for their submissions, but sharing these pages during the review period may inadvertently expose their identity, violating **double-blind review** policies. If you're facing similar concerns, you can email your project page to NanaBot, and it will be published anonymously on our website: [NamaeNashiBot.github.io](https://namaenashibot.github.io) 🌐.

## 📋 Important Notes

1. ⚠️ **File Size**: It is recommended that your submitted page does not exceed **25MB**. If your page contains large videos 🎥, NanaBot will work on processing them appropriately. Additionally, it's best to use **relative paths** when creating your page to ensure everything loads correctly.
2. 🛑 **Content Review**: NanaBot **will not** review the technical content of your submission or check if it complies with double-blind review policies 🔐. Only harmful content (e.g., malware) will be moderated. Submitters are **responsible** for any risks related to double-blind submissions.
3. 📧 **Confirmation**: You will receive a confirmation email upon successful submission. NanaBot will host your project page for up to **3 months** (the typical review period for most conferences) ⏳. After this period, if you move the page to a personal account, NanaBot will retain the original URL and set up a **redirection** 🔄 to your new address. You may also request other changes via email.

## 🛠️ Additional Features

NanaBot can also help you by creating an **empty GitHub repository** 📂 on request and transferring ownership to the author when necessary 📨.
